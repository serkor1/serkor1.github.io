Dogecoin; an all-time Elon Musk favorite. But what happens when he tweets (well now he X'es, I guess) about it?

Here is a case-study of his famous tweet and how the markets reacted in the seconds up to, and after the tweet.

## The famous tweet
<center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One word: Doge</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1340590280848908288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Analyzing the Dogecoin price action

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Time conversion"}
The `getQuote()`-function assumes times are passed as `UTC`, and this blogpost is written from `CET`
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| message: true
# load library
as.POSIXct(
  as.POSIXct("2020-12-20 9:30:00", tz = 'UTC'),
  tz = "CET"
)
```

To analyze the price action around the tweet, we will look at the 1 second and 5 minute chart. 

### Analyzing price action on the 1 second chart

```{r}
## getting Dogecoin
## on the 1 second chart
## from Binance around the
## time Elon Musk tweeted
DOGEUSDT <- cryptoQuotes::getQuote(
  ticker   = "DOGEUSDT",
  source   = "binance",
  futures  = FALSE,
  interval = "1s",
  from     = "2020-12-20 9:29:00",
  to       = "2020-12-20 9:32:00"
)
```

```{r}
#| label: 1s chart
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| message: false
#| fig-height: 10

## chart the price action
## using klines
cryptoQuotes::chart(
  chart = cryptoQuotes::kline(
    DOGEUSDT
  )
)
```


At its lowest around the time of tweet Dogecoin were priced at `r min(DOGEUSDT$Low)`\$, and at its highest it were priced at `r max(DOGEUSDT$Low)`\$ - that is an `r round((max(DOGEUSDT$Low)/min(DOGEUSDT$Low) - 1) * 100)`\% increase!



### Analyzing price action on the 5 minute chart

```{r}
## getting Dogecoin
## on the 5 minute chart
## from Binance around the
## time Elon Musk tweeted
DOGEUSDT <- cryptoQuotes::getQuote(
  ticker   = "DOGEUSDT",
  source   = "binance",
  futures  = FALSE,
  interval = "5m",
  from     = "2020-12-20 9:25:00",
  to       = "2020-12-20 10:00:00"
)
```

```{r}
#| label: 5m chart
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| message: false
#| fig-height: 10

## chart the price action
## using klines
cryptoQuotes::chart(
  chart = cryptoQuotes::kline(
    DOGEUSDT
  )
)
```


At its lowest around the time of tweet Dogecoin were priced at `r min(DOGEUSDT$Low)`\$, and at its highest it were priced at `r max(DOGEUSDT$Low)`\$ - that is an `r round((max(DOGEUSDT$Low)/min(DOGEUSDT$Low) - 1) * 100)`\% increase!

## The power of tweets, or Elon Musk

An increase of 7\% over the course 3 minutes and 15\% within 35 minutes is, albeit not uncommon in the cryptocurrency markets, scary - especially if you are a Bear!
